## ✨ AI-Powered Prompt Generation

The app features an **offline AI prompt generator** for both Prompts and Vibe Prompts:

- Tap the ✨ (sparkles) button in the Prompts or Vibe Prompts list.
- The app uses a Markov chain model (built from the local CSV corpus) to generate a new, unique prompt.
- For Prompts: The "Act/Role" field is filled with a random act from the corpus, suffixed with "(AI Generated)", and the prompt text is generated.
- For Vibe Prompts: The "App Name" field is filled with a random app name from the corpus, suffixed with "(AI Generated)", and the prompt text is generated.
- The add prompt sheet opens, prefilled with the generated content, so you can review, edit, and save it to your collection.
- All generation is done **fully offline** and instantly, with no network or external AI service required.

This feature lets you expand your prompt collection with creative, AI-inspired ideas—anytime, anywhere!
